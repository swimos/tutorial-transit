SwimOS Transit Tutorial

## Running the UI

1. Make sure the backend application is running in the `server` directory (`./tutorial-transit/server`).
2. Next, go to your web browser and open the `index.html` file located in the `ui` directory (`./tutorial-transit/ui/index.html`).
3. You should see buses populate above were Los Angeles is written on the map, and to the left of Pasadena.
4. It can be helpful to inspect the websocket traffic (on Chrome, View > Developer > Developer Tools), in which case, find the WS tab and click on localhost.
